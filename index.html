	<p>Coming in as underdogs in the 2020 football season, Coastal Carolina University (CCU) has recently earned a name for itself nationwide. In the 2020 football season, CCU finished the regular season with a record breaking 11 wins and 0 losses. With victories against other ranked universities such as Louisiana and Brigham-Young, Coastal ended the season ranked number 14 in the country by the Associated Press Top 25 Poll. As CCU climbed the rankings, they grew massively in popularity, eventually having games aired nationwide. Coastal's game against Brigham-Young University on December 5th, 2020 was even shown for the ESPN College GameDay.</p>

	<p>For the 2021 football season, Coastal is keeping up the same pace, being currently undefeated as of October 8th, 2021. As of now, Coastal has triumphed over The Citadel, Kansas, Buffalo, UMass, ULM, and Arkansas State, with upcoming games against Appalachian State, Troy, Georgia Southern, Georgia State, Texas State, and South Alabama.</p>
	<p>Recently, CCU broke their record for highest attendance in their game versus the University of Kansas on September 10th, 2021, with 17,697 people attending. On October 2nd, 2021, Coastal beat this record again in their game against the University of Louisiana-Monroe (ULM), with 18,674 fans in attendance. The game against ULM also occurred during CCU’s Family Weekend, with many students going to the game with their visiting family members.</p>

	<p>Currently, Coastal Carolina University is ranked number 15 in the country, being the only ranked team in South Carolina since Clemson University’s loss to North Carolina State and slim victory against Boston College.</p>
	<p>Coastal Carolina students are able to get into home games for free, as well as being able to purchase three extra guest tickets for $15 each. These free student tickets, as well as the guest tickets, allow for a space in the student section of Brooks Stadium, affectionately known as the “Teal Tidal Wave” by Coach Jamey Chadwell.</p>

	<p>Chadwell has been CCU’s football coach since January 2019. Following his amazing 2020 season, Chadwell was the recipient of six different awards: The AP College Football Coach of the Year, The Walter Camp Coach of the Year, the Home Depot Coach of the Year, the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, the George Munger Award, and the Sun Belt Coach of the Year.</p>
	<p>Not only are CCU’s games brimming with school pride, they even have their own live mascot: Maddox the Rooster. A student vote was held in 2011 to name the rooster, and Maddox was chosen in honor of former basketball coach and English professor Cal F. Maddox, who named the school’s mascot the Chanticleer.</p>
	<p>Finally, Coastal Carolina just put a new statue of our mascot, Chauncey the Chanticleer, in front of Brooks Stadium. The statue stands at 12 feet tall, and cost the school $50,000 dollars, paid for with auxiliary funds from things like vending machines and concessions. The statue was put in place on September 21st, 2021.</p>

	<p>I reached out to a Coastal Carolina University alum, Alex Long (’21) about his feelings on Coastal’s latest football seasons. He replied: “So as an alum it’s been awesome to see Coastal do so well in football. I’ve been keeping up with the games every week, even when they’re not on TV, and I’m looking forward to us going to a bowl game again. I can’t wait to see a game in person again.”</p>
	<p>As a student at CCU, I’m proud to see our team doing so well. Before coming to Coastal, I never had much interest in football, but as I see our team flourishing, I can’t help but keep track of every game that we play. It’s been an interesting journey seeing how quickly we’ve grown. Mar Pepin, an Information Specialist for CHANT411, told me that they have been getting a lot more questions from students about how to get their tickets – this just goes to show how much more interest our team is receiving now.</p>
